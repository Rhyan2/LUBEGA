#CANCER AWARENESS.

# What is cancer
Cancer is a group of diseases characterized by the uncontrolled growth and spread of abnormal cells. These cells can form tumors or invade other tissues and organs, disrupting their normal functions. There are over 100 types of cancer, each with unique characteristics and treatment approaches.

## CAUSES OF CANCER

### Genetic Factors: Some cancers have a hereditary component, meaning they can be passed down through generations. Understanding your family history can provide valuable insights into your risk factors.

### Environmental Exposures: Exposure to certain substances in the environment, such as tobacco smoke, pollutants, and radiation, can increase the risk of developing cancer. Adopting a healthy lifestyle and minimizing exposure to known carcinogens can help reduce this risk.

### Lifestyle Choices: Unhealthy lifestyle choices, such as a poor diet, lack of physical activity, and excessive alcohol consumption, can contribute to the development of cancer. Making positive lifestyle changes can play a crucial role in cancer prevention.

### Viral Infections: Some viruses, such as human papillomavirus (HPV), hepatitis B and C, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), are linked to an increased risk of certain cancers. Vaccination and preventive measures are essential in managing these risks.

### Age and Hormonal Factors: As individuals age, the risk of developing cancer generally increases. Additionally, hormonal factors, such as hormonal therapies and reproductive history, can influence cancer risk in certain types of cancers.
